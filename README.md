# About
Small showcase of a seemingly undocumented API at mappan.is, focused on the PÃ³stbox features (Icelandic post office web portal)  

It makes an authentication call, get's a token from user/pass  
uses that token to make another call and recieves a json with active shipments  
prints out that JSON  

#### So, What can I use this project for ?
Standalone, nothing. This is not intended as some fully featured software, just a small code showcase
